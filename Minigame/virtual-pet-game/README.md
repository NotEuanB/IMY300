# Virtual Pet Game

## Overview
This project is a virtual pet game where players can care for a digital pet. Players must manage their pet's needs, including food, health, happiness, and energy. The game features interactive mini-games, a leveling system, and customization options for the pet.

## Features
- **Pet Needs**: The pet has four basic needs that players must satisfy:
  - Food
  - Health
  - Happiness
  - Energy

- **Mini-Games**: Players can engage in three mini-games that affect the pet's growth:
  - **Feeding Game**: Players feed their pet to satisfy its hunger.
  - **Play Game**: Players interact with their pet to increase happiness and energy.
  - **Exercise Game**: Players help their pet stay active, impacting health and energy.

- **Time Management**: The game includes a real-world clock feature where the pet sleeps at 10 PM. Players must manage the pet's needs over time, with options to speed up time for testing purposes.

- **Evolution System**: The pet can evolve based on the player's care. For example, neglecting the pet may lead to it becoming thin, while regular play may result in a more muscular appearance.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- **scenes/**: Contains all the scene files for the game.
- **scripts/**: Contains all the GDScript files that manage game logic.
- **assets/**: Contains visual and audio assets used in the game.
- **data/**: Contains JSON files for storing pet stats and evolution data.
